1-the differences between batch, script, and transaction in SQL Server is vital for effective database management. 
Batches are atomic units of work that consist of one or more SQL statements executed sequentially. 
Scripts are collections of batches executed together as a logical unit,
while transactions ensure the ACID properties and maintain data integrity. By grasping these distinctions,
developers and database administrators can optimize their SQL Server operations and ensure the reliability of their databases.
2-triggers are event-driven database objects that automatically execute in response to specific events on a table,
while stored procedures are named collections of SQL statements that can be called and executed multiple times, 
promoting code reusability and modularity in the application.  
3-stored procedures are primarily used for encapsulating complex logic and performing actions, 
while functions are focused on returning specific values or result sets. 
Stored procedures can have various return types or no return type, 
and they can contain transaction control statements. Functions must have a defined return type,
cannot have transaction control statements, and are commonly used within queries or expressions. 
4-the DROP statement removes entire database objects, 
the TRUNCATE statement removes all rows from a table quickly, 
and the DELETE statement selectively removes specific rows based on specified criteria. 
DROP is irreversible, TRUNCATE is faster but removes all data, 
and DELETE allows selective removal and provides options for recovery.
5- the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from existing tables,
while the SELECT INTO statement creates a new table and populates it with the result set of a SELECT statement.
The SELECT statement allows for data retrieval, filtering, and sorting,
while the SELECT INTO statement is used for creating new tables based on the structure and data returned by a SELECT statement.  
6-local variables have a limited scope and are accessible only within a specific block of code,
while global variables have a broader scope and can be accessed from anywhere within the program or script. 
Local variables exist only during the execution of the block of code where they are declared,
while global variables persist throughout the entire execution of the program or script. 
7-both CONVERT and CAST statements are used for data type conversion in SQL.
CONVERT provides more flexibility in specifying the target data type and formatting options, 
while CAST has a simpler syntax and is supported by many database systems as part of the SQL standard.        
8-DDL is for defining and managing the structure of the database, 
DML is for manipulating data, DCL is for controlling access and permissions,
DQL is for querying data, and TCL is for managing transactions. 
Each category plays a specific role in the overall management and utilization of a relational database. 
9-SQL Server Authentication requires a specific SQL Server username and password managed by SQL Server,
while Windows Authentication relies on Windows user accounts for authentication, 
leveraging the underlying Windows security mechanisms.
Windows Authentication is often considered more secure and is commonly used in enterprise environments.
10-the main difference lies in how data is physically stored on disk. 
A clustered index determines the physical order of the table, while a non-clustered index provides a separate,
ordered structure to enhance query performance without affecting the physical order of the data.
11-GROUP BY ROLLUP and GROUP BY CUBE are extensions to the standard SQL GROUP BY clause. 
They are used to generate subtotals and grand totals in result sets, providing a convenient way to summarize data.
12-inline functions return a table-like result and are often used for more complex logic,while views provide a
virtual representation of a query's result and are commonly used for simplifying queries and encapsulating logic.
13-while both functions provide a way to assign ranks to rows based on a specified order,
ROW_NUMBER() assigns unique integers without consideration for ties, 
while DENSE_RANK() handles ties by assigning the same rank to tied rows.
