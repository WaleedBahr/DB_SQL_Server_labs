This repository contains solutions to SQL Server labs completed during the study at the Information Technology Institute from day 1 to day 9.

## Labs Overview

Each lab exercise is organized into separate folders according to the assigned day. Inside each folder, you will find the following:

1. `README.md`: Provides a brief description of the lab exercise.
2. SQL script files (`*.sql`): Contains the SQL queries, commands, and solutions for the lab tasks.
3. Optionally, any additional resources or documentation related to the lab.
